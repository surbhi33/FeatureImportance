# FeatureImportance
Implementation of various feature importance algorithms from scratch Spearmen's correl, PCA, mRMR, Permutation and Drop Importance. This repository will also compare available methods for finding importance and variables and explain its pros and cons in different scenarios. 


The goal of this repo is to explore various methods available to increase any machine learning model's explainibility which is Feature Importance.The report will go through what feature importance means , techniques used in industry and academic,its comparison and briefly touches upon feature selection.It will give understanding of how these algorithms work and its implementation on Python.We will see many visualizations as it's most importances aspect of showcasing feature importance. We will parallely cover its applications and later we will touch upon possible pitfalls in available methods and future scope of improvements.

Dataset used : Scikit.datasets , Boston data for house pricing.
